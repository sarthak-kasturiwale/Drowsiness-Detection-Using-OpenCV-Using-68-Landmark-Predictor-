# Drowsiness-Detection-Using-OpenCV-Using-68-Landmark-Predictor-
- Driver drowsiness detection is a car safety technology which helps prevent accidents caused by the driver getting drowsy. Various studies have suggested that around 20% of all road accidents are fatigue-related, up to 50% on certain roads.
- Though Drowsiness Dection System uses various measures to detect Drowsiness like Steering pattern monitoring, Vehicle position in lane monitoring, Driver eye/face monitoring etc we only focus on Driver eyes monitoring.
- In this project we have successfully built the Drowsiness Detection System using Driver eyes monitoring by leveraging ^* Landmark Predictor & OpenCV.
